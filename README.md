# 📊 Fair and Sustainable Energy Usage Predictions: An AI and Ethics Case Study

## 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a time-series machine learning model to predict household energy consumption using historical data. In addition to the technical modeling aspect, the project explores ethical considerations surrounding AI in energy systems — including privacy, equity, transparency, and sustainability.

The dataset used is `household_power_consumption.csv`, which contains real-world energy usage metrics over time.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Name:** `household_power_consumption.csv`
- **Source:** Available on Blackboard
- **Description:** Includes historical energy usage data with timestamps and contextual variables like voltage, intensity, and sub-metering data.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Tasks

This is a **time-series regression** task. The notebook includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (e.g., time of day, date-related features)
- Model development (regression using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM)
- Forecasting future energy consumption (e.g., hourly or daily)
- Visualization of predictions and model performance

> Optional: Classification of usage patterns into high, medium, or low categories based on thresholds

## 🧠 Ethical Analysis

The notebook also investigates and discusses the following ethical questions:

1. **Bias in Access**
   - How might energy forecasting models favor certain socio-economic groups or geographic areas?
   - Considerations of energy equity in access to predictive technologies.

2. **Privacy Concerns**
   - Risks associated with using granular, real-time energy data (e.g., user profiling or surveillance).
   - Balancing utility and personal privacy.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - Methods to make AI decisions interpretable (e.g., SHAP values, model explanations).
   - Ensuring accountability in prediction errors or unfair recommendations.

4. **Sustainability**
   - Can the model suggest energy-efficient behavior?
   - Preventing penalization of vulnerable groups (e.g., low-income households) while promoting sustainable habits.
